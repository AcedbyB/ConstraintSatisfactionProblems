CSP by Bao Tran

To run my code, simply compile every .java file in this folder and then run the Main class.
I tried to name everything carefully so that someone who has never seen it before could understand it pretty well.

To be brief, I have:
+ A CSP parent class that will be extend to more specific CSP.
+ An only Solver class that will be passed in the CSP and solve it.
+ The AC-3 are included inside the CSP class itself, ready to be call for any CSP problems.
+ 1 corresponding CSP class for every problem.

The rest of the guide needed to test my code would be in the running process and also in the submission form
included with it.
